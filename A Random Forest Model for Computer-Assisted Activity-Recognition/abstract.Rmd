We use predictive models to create a statistical model of future behavior. In particular, we examine how well a random forest predictive model would predict the classification of a new lift by the same experimental subjects. We separate the data into training and test sets using the variable `num_window` to ensure that a single lift is not in both sets. We find that a random forest model can accurately and 'honestly' predict the classifications of the weight lift type performed by the experimental subjects.
